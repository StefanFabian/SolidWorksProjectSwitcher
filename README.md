# SolidWorksProjectSwitcher
Speeds up your workflow by allowing you to quickly change your current project in SolidWorks.

##Set-Up
Either compile the program from source or download an already compiled version here

Change the path in **solidworkspath.ini** to the path of your SolidWorks executable.  
Make sure the file only contains the path and no leading or trailing whitespaces or newlines.  
**Specify the path using backslashes as separator!**  
For example:
  
*C:\Program Files\SolidWorksPath\SldWorks.exe*  
  
Now update the process name in **solidworksprocessname.ini**.  
The default is:
  
*SLDWORKS*

**Sidenote:** The case is in this case ignored, so sldworks would work as well.  
**This only applies to the solidworksprocessname.ini!**

And finally, change the value in solidworksprojectfolder.ini to the folder you usually use for your projects  
For example:

*C:\solidworksproject*

**It is very important to use only a single backslash as separator!**
